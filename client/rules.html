            <p>
                Not all AI models are built the same. The AI model's response varies based on the data it was trained on. In this game, you will interact with <b>Three</b> AI models by presenting them different cards to recognize.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each AI model was trained on different data and has different capabilities. The AI models can only recognize the cards they were trained on. You need to figure out which dataset the models can regonize: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Sahara Set: Zebra, Pig, Giraffe, Tiger, and Rhino</li>
                <li>Forest Set: Penguin, Dog, Horse, Bear, and Owl</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>
                On the last page you'll have to categorize the cards into the correct set. You will be given a score based on the number of correct categorizations!
